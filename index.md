## For Devs

A real world example is used to show how a set of simple rules can be used
together with a small open source tool to turn a complex software
into one that is easy to understand and maintain.

To achieve this you don't need big frameworks or a complex organization but only:
* a set of simple rules,
* a small open source tool to document the new software structure and
* of course a clear mind willing to simplify things.

The result has got the following properties:
* The discoverability is excellent.
* All components are independent of each other.
* It is normal idiomatic Go code (no funny patterns).
* The debugability is great.
* The hard parts of clean code are fulfilled without any effort.
* Even when requirements change refactoring will be rare.
* Necessary refactorings are straight forward, simple and quick.

These properties make the code indestructible (by changing requirements) and highly valuable for a long time.

## For Product people
* finally understand what is going on
* much better complexity predictions
* feels empowered

## For Management
* much better complexity predictions
* much lower maintenance costs
* feels in control

## For All
* less/no problem vs solution domain mismatch
* can work together much better
* find conflicts much earlier
